    REINFORCE loss with tanh-bounded actions has NO lower bound because:
    
    1. Actions near boundary (e.g., 149.9 when MAX_TORQUE=150) require
       unbounded values ~1000 before tanh squashing
       
    2. Log probability = log N(1000; μ, σ²) - log|det J_tanh|
       - Normal log prob ≈ -1,000,000 (very unlikely)
       - Jacobian correction ≈ +999,990 (partial cancellation)
       - Net log prob ≈ -10 to -100
       
    3. With positive advantage A=100:
       Loss = -(-10 × 100) = -1000
       
    4. As policy becomes more confident:
       - More extreme actions
       - More negative log probs
       - Loss → -∞
       
    This is EXPECTED and doesn't indicate a problem!
    What matters: actual returns and success rate, not loss value.
