Review recent changes according to coding guidelines as given in CLAUDE.md.
You may and should use git.
Ensure that newer code (uncommitted, latest commit, etc) conforms to previous code, which you can use as a template/inspiration for how to do things.
Propose SPECIFIC, localized changes.
Don't forget to regularly rerun linting, type checking, testing.
Hunt for duplication, ensure proper use of named constants and intermediate variables, small functions, lack of over-engineering, correctness, etc.
